# Gene birth and death in *Caenorhabditis elegans*

This repository contains all the code used in the project "Gene birth and death in *Caenorhabditis elegans*".

The Snakemake pipeline was run from the workflow directory on the cluster or local machine as appropriate.

Some of the scripts were adapted from those of Cristian Riccio and Hannah Uri.
Snakemake was configured to operate on SLURM using the cookiecuttter at https://github.com/Snakemake-Profiles/slurm.
